CASE BRIEF: PMM Grocery Supermarket
PMM Grocery Supermarket has decided to move from manual ways of doing things into
digitalize method of operation. They require a new database management system to replace the
original system they had in place as this is no longer viable for the amount of data they are
storing. They would like a design for a centralised database that allows web interface access
for the employees and customers.
PMM Grocery Supermarket is an Hampshire supermarket with branches in Waterlooville,
Fareham, Gosport, Havant, Chichester with Portsmouth as the head office.
Staff work in different locations based on the shift pattern and each location have a
manager who oversees the affairs of the the location. And store manager will report
to the headoffice.
PMM Grocery Supermarket sells products under different categories like beverages,
bread/bakery, Canned/Jarred goods, Dairy, Dry/baking goods, frozenfoods, meats,
produce, cleaners, personal care, paper goods etc. And each product will have details
like product price, product Id, product name, ingredients, allergy advice, lifestyle,
size/volume, net weight, direction for use, nutrition info, country of origin, storage
instruction and maunfacturer.

even after the transaction are completed.
PMM Grocery Supermarket need to be able to run regular reports on their database
to ensure they are able to run a successful business.

• All products with details and prices
• Order record and delivery details.
• Report of product availability and their location
• Monthly income generated per city/location
You are a junior database administrator (DBA) working for a Systems Development
company and have been in post approximately 9 months. During this time, you have been
working on existing database systems that have been developed by the Company’s Senior
DBA. (You can assume that Olumuyiwa and the teaching team would have this role.)
One of the Company’s clients has asked for a system to be developed for them (see above case
study). The Senior DBA does not have the time to devote to this project yet and so has
asked you to work out the design, development and justification. Therefore, the work you
produce is for a Senior DBA – to save them thinking time when starting the project – and as
such you can assume they understand more about databases than you do. Your report should
take this into account and you should not describe or explain topics that the Senior DBA already
knows but you should analyse their importance and relevance in the given scenario.
Task T1: EERD (15 marks)
Using the information given in the case study, draw an Enhanced Entity-Relationship Diagram
for the database system. Do NOT include any attributes.
The EERD should fit on ONE page and MUST be produced electronically. Hand-drawn
diagrams will receive NO marks.
There are a number of free or trial-period EERD drawing software packages that you can use,
Like Lucidchart which is free to create an account with your University email.
Task T2: Rationale and Assumptions (10 marks)
Clearly state any assumptions you have made about the system. Assumptions are made when
the case study text does not give you enough information. These assumptions should only relate
to the design of the system. For example, you may have decided to include or omit certain
entities, or you may have decided to generalise rather than specialize some entities – tell us why
you did this. (ca 200 words)
Task T3: Data Dictionary/ Scripts (30 marks)
Create a data dictionary for the tables you have identified in your EERD. Don’t forget the
intersection tables for any many-to-many relationships. The tables should contain a logical
range of attributes and clearly indicate the keys. All tables should be in 3NF.
For each table, the data dictionary should include the following:
● The attributes for the table, as they will be named in the database
● The data type and size you have chosen for each attribute
● Where appropriate, whether an attribute is a Primary Key or could be an Alternate Key
● For Foreign Keys, the table they relate to
You must use the template we have provided for you at the end of this document to complete
this task.
Task T4: SQL Queries (45 marks)
Create and populate a working database for the given case study. You should take on board the
feedback from us given for all exercises and class examples on EERD and data dictionary when
creating the required tables.
Write THREE SQL statements that reflect the needs of the business. These statements
should include some of the more complex SQL syntax you have learned this year.
You will be required to run your queries and submit the screenshot of both the queries and their
outputs.
The marking will be for:
● The level of complexity of each query,
● The query being of use to the business,
● Good input and output formatting,
● Good design (relating back to the EERD & Data Dictionary),
● Use of any feedback you have received about your design – not compulsory
● Use of additional features such as constraints etc.,
● Good differentiation among your queries
